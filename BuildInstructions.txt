GETTING STARTED:

    1. Make sure you have python installed.
    2. Intsall boto3 aws SDK with the command below:
        - pip install boto3

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING consumer.py:

    1. Open a command line, and navigate to the folder in which consumer.py is located.
    2. Type into the command line the following:

        a) python3 consumer.py {BucketFrom} {BucketTo/TableTo} {-bucket/-table}

            - BucketFrom --> Bucket in which the requests reside
            - BucketTo/TableTo --> Bucket or DynamoDB Table in which creation objects should go top
            - -bucket/-table --> write -bucket if above option is S3 bucket, or -table if above option is DynamoDB Table

        Example:
            python3 consumer.py usu-cs5260-miketa-requests usu-cs5260-miketa-web -bucket

Note:
    The logging file will be replaced each time you run the program. Edit the 'logging.basicConfig(filename="consumer.log",
    format='%(asctime)s %(message)s',
    filemode='w')' line of code to change this. 
                    
    Modify the filename for different locations on each run, if needed.
