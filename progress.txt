What is done:
    1. Set up functionality for getting top object from a bucket, and displaying its contents with JSON.
    2. Set up functionality for command-line arguments for storage strategy and resources to use.
        a) First argument: python3, consumer.py
        b) Second argument: Name of bucket to grab widgets from.
        c) Third argument: Named of bucket/DB table to place widgets.
        d) Fourth argument:

            - '-table' --> third argument is a table
    3. Set up functionality for deleting the top object after being processed.
    4. Set up functionality for creating object when type of request is 'create', and places the new object into specified s3 bucket.

What still needs to be done:
    1. Correctly add all data to new object.
    2. Create functionality for adding object to DynamoDB table.
    3. Create Unit Test functionality.
    4. Create log file functionality.
